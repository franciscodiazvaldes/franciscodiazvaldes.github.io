I am a PhD student in Economics and Management at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I hold a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Economics at the [University of Chile](https://econ.uchile.cl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

Previously, I served as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [School of Business and Economics, Universidad de los Andes, Chile](https://www.uandes.cl/sbe/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where I worked with Professor [Jorge Alé-Chilet](https://sites.google.com/site/jorgealechilet/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on empirical industrial organization topics. 

I’m interested in empirical and theoretical industrial organization and the intersection of mechanism design and market design.

My CV is available [here](files/CV/CV.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and you can contact me at [e.g.duque@lse.ac.uk](mailto:e.g.duque@lse.ac.uk).

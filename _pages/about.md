I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://economics.ucla.edu/graduate/ph-d-program/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I hold a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Economics from the [University of Chile](https://econ.uchile.cl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

Previously, I served as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [School of Business and Economics, Universidad de los Andes, Chile](https://www.uandes.cl/sbe/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where I worked with Professors [Alvaro García-Marín](https://sites.google.com/site/afgarciama/home){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Juan Pablo Xandri](https://jxandri.com/home). 

I’m interested in Macroeconomics with Heterogeneous Agents, Macro-Finance, and Computational Economics.
